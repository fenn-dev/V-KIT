# The Vulpine Programming Language

## Long story short

- Powerful Inheritance
In many OOP languages, classes can inherit properties of classes, and structs of structs, but in Vulpine.
Even variables can inherit variable types! When you first create a Variable and want to assign it a type as in
`let var: int;` You can see that the created variable has inherited the properties of the int type.
This unique property is especially powerful with WildCard Variables in order to read them as a specific type!

- Everything returns
In Vulpine, everything has a value, so why not return them? You can make a variable equal to the result of an if check as long as it exposes a variable at the end by for example doing "variableName;"
